# README

I built this app after a conversation with my manager. She mentioned how important it can be to focus on positive interactions, and less on what you *think* you might have done wrong.

You can log in, and add positive feedback onto a board which persists through a Postgres database, so you can view all the positive stuff people have said about you.

I used Rails as it had a lot of the things I needed to use out of the box. Scaffolding the database and adding Postgres was a breeze, as well as editing the schema with ActiveRecord.

I need to add some error handling and the responsive Bootstrap nav needs tinkering with, as well as the media queries for small screens.

* Ruby version 2.7.4

* Rails version 7.0.1

* Postgres version 14.1
